# Object-Oriented Programming in Perl
Example code in Perl to talk about OO programming

The basic example comes from the TutorialsPoint: <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/perl/perl_object_oriented.htm>

For information on Perl Moose: <http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl_2014/07-object-oriented-perl.html>

It has been modified to illustrate some of the different OO principles:

* Classes
* Methods
* Attributes (Instance variables)
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
